# Systems analysis tools

This repository contains the different mathematical tools developed by the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.kt.dtu.dk/english/research/prosys) to assess and predict mass and volumetric flow in wastewater treatment plants

<strong>1. Data reconciliation tools </strong>  

The Main developers are: Vicente Monje, [Xavier Flores-Alsina](https://github.com/xfalsina) and [Krist V. Gernaey](https://github.com/kristgernaey). The model is described in the following paper:
